 * Talon.One API

 * The Talon.One API is used to manage applications and campaigns, as well as to integrate with your application. The operations in the _Integration API_ section are used to integrate with our platform, while the other operations are used to manage applications and campaigns.  ### Where is the API?  The API is available at the same hostname as these docs. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerProfile][] operation is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v1/customer_profiles/id`  [updateCustomerProfile]: #operation- -v1-customer_profiles- -integrationId- -put

If you have multiple ways of accessing the same application you can either:  - Track multiple independent sessions or, - Use the same session across all of them.  You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the user&#39;s cart. If two points of access to the application have independent states, for example a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.  To link a session to a customer profile, set the &#x60;profileId&#x60; parameter in the request body to a customer profile&#39;s &#x60;integrationId&#x60;. To track an anonymous session use the empty string (&#x60;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;) as the &#x60;profileId&#x60;. **Note:** You do **not** have to create a customer profile first. If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is created automatically.  Updating a customer profile returns a response with the full integration state. This includes the current state of the customer profile, the customer session, the event that was recorded, and an array of effects that took place.  The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as that of the application with which the session is associated.
