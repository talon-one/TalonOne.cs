 * Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to manage applications and campaigns:  - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api) are used to integrate with our platform - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to manage applications and campaigns.  ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints  The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerSession](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api/#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`

You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the user&#39;s cart. If two points of access to the application have independent states, for example a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.

For example, use this endpoint to share the content of a customer&#39;s cart with Talon.One and to check which promotion rules apply.  **Note:** The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as the Application that owns this session.  **Session management**  The Talon.One platform supports multiple simultaneous sessions for the same profile. If you have multiple ways of accessing the same Application you can either:  - Track multiple independent sessions or, - Use the same session across all of them.  You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the user&#39;s cart. If two points of access to the application have independent states, for example a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.  See more information and tips about session management in the [documentation](/docs/dev/concepts/entities#customer-session).  **Sessions and customer profiles**  - To link a session to a customer profile, set the &#x60;profileId&#x60; parameter in the request body to a customer profile&#39;s &#x60;integrationId&#x60;. - While you can create an anonymous session with &#x60;profileId&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;, we recommend you use a guest ID instead.  **Note:** You do **not** have to create a customer profile first.

For example, use this endpoint to share the content of a customer&#39;s cart with Talon.One and to check which promotion rules apply.  **Note:** The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as the Application that owns this session.  **Session management**  The Talon.One platform supports multiple simultaneous sessions for the same profile. If you have multiple ways of accessing the same Application you can either:  - Track multiple independent sessions or, - Use the same session across all of them.  You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the user&#39;s cart. If two points of access to the application have independent states, for example a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.  See more information and tips about session management in the [documentation](/docs/dev/concepts/entities#customer-session).  **Sessions and customer profiles**  - To link a session to a customer profile, set the &#x60;profileId&#x60; parameter in the request body to a customer profile&#39;s &#x60;integrationId&#x60;. - While you can create an anonymous session with &#x60;profileId&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;, we recommend you use a guest ID instead.  **Note:** You do **not** have to create a customer profile first. If the specified profile does not exist, an empty profile is created automatically.  **Performance tips**  Updating a customer session returns a response with the requested integration state.
