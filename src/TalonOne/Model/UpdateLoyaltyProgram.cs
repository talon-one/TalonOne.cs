 * Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to manage applications and campaigns:  - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api) are used to integrate with our platform - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to manage applications and campaigns.  ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints  The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment. For example, if you access the Campaign Manager at `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerSessionV2](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint is `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`
